Unix commands are the basic utilities and tools used to interact with the Unix operating system.

These commands form the foundation of working in a Unix environment. By combining them in various ways, you can perform complex tasks efficiently.

Creating a Unix shell script is a common way to write a Unix program. Shell scripts are sequences of commands written in a file, which can be executed to perform various tasks. Here is an example of a simple Unix shell script that performs basic file operations and system information retrieval.

### Example Shell Script: System Info and File Backup

This script will:
1. Display system information.
2. Check for the existence of a directory and create it if it does not exist.
3. Back up a specified file to that directory.
4. Log the operations performed.

#### Step 1: Create the Shell Script File

Open your favorite text editor and create a new file named `backup_script.sh`.

#### Step 2: Write the Shell Script

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Script to display system information and backup a file

# Function to display system information
function display_sys_info() {
    echo "System Information:"
    echo "--------------------"
    echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
    echo "Date and Time: $(date)"
    echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
    echo "Logged-in Users: $(who)"
    echo "Free Memory: $(free -h)"
    echo "Disk Usage: $(df -h)"
    echo ""
}

# Function to back up a file
function backup_file() {
    local FILE=$1
    local BACKUP_DIR=$2

    if [ ! -f "$FILE" ]; then
        echo "Error: File '$FILE' not found."
        return 1
    fi

    if [ ! -d "$BACKUP_DIR" ]; then
        echo "Backup directory '$BACKUP_DIR' does not exist. Creating it..."
        mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
    fi

    cp "$FILE" "$BACKUP_DIR"
    echo "File '$FILE' backed up to '$BACKUP_DIR'."
}

# Function to log operations
function log_operations() {
    local LOG_FILE=$1
    shift
    local MESSAGE=$@

    echo "$(date): $MESSAGE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Main script
LOG_FILE="backup_script.log"
BACKUP_DIR="backup"

# Display system information
display_sys_info | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

# File to back up (passed as an argument to the script)
FILE_TO_BACKUP=$1

if [ -z "$FILE_TO_BACKUP" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <file_to_backup>"
    exit 1
fi

# Back up the file and log the operation
backup_file "$FILE_TO_BACKUP" "$BACKUP_DIR"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    log_operations "$LOG_FILE" "File '$FILE_TO_BACKUP' backed up successfully."
else
    log_operations "$LOG_FILE" "Failed to back up file '$FILE_TO_BACKUP'."
fi
```

#### Step 3: Make the Script Executable

Save the file and exit the text editor. Then, make the script executable using the `chmod` command:

```sh
chmod +x backup_script.sh
```

#### Step 4: Run the Script

Execute the script by providing the file you want to back up as an argument:

```sh
./backup_script.sh example.txt
```

### Explanation of the Script

- **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**: Specifies the script should be run with the Bash shell.
- **Functions (`display_sys_info`, `backup_file`, `log_operations`)**: Define reusable blocks of code for displaying system information, backing up a file, and logging operations.
- **`display_sys_info`**: Gathers and displays system information.
- **`backup_file`**: Checks if the file exists and if the backup directory exists (creates it if not), then copies the file to the backup directory.
- **`log_operations`**: Appends messages to a log file with a timestamp.
- **Main script logic**: Displays system information, checks for the presence of the file to back up, performs the backup, and logs the outcome.

This script demonstrates basic file operations, condition checking, function definitions, and logging in Unix shell scripting.
